Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I wish I had wings
Take me away from all that I see
All the trouble I make
Wish I could fly high above everything
Oh, I wish I had wings
I'd dance with the angels
Cut through the clouds
Never look back, never come back down
Drunk on the wind and the high it brings
Free once again, it never ends
Oh, I wish I had wings
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I wish I had wings
Instead of all these memories
I almost believe they couldn't follow me
I could fly high above everything
Oh, I wish I had wings
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
